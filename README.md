**Naty's Pokédex**
---
Naty's Pokédex is a web application built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created to reinforce and demonstrate my understanding 
of core front-end development principles without relying on frameworks.

The app fetches data from the PokéAPI and dynamically renders Pokémon stats, moves, and details based on user input. Users can search 
for any Pokémon and view detailed information presented in an interactive and user-friendly interface.

---
**Key features include**:

**DOM Manipulation**: Rendered and updated the DOM dynamically, based on user interaction and inputs.

**Live Search**: Search for Pokémon, by name, from the PokéAPI -- sort results by name or ID. 

**API Integration**: Fetching and parsing external JSON data from PokéAPI.

**Dynamic Rendering**: Displaying Pokémon data such as types, stats, and abilities based on user selection.

**State Management**: Implementing a simple state structure to manage application data.

**LocalStorage Integration**: Allowing users to save Pokémon to their Favorites or Caught lists, with data persistence across sessions.

**Modular Codebase with MVC Pattern**: Organized code using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure clean code separation, scalability, and maintainability:

- Model handles data fetching, state logic, and transformations.

- View manages all UI updates and DOM rendering.

- Controller handles user input and orchestrates interactions between the Model and View.

**Upcoming Features**:

**Geolocation Module**: Incorporating the Geolocation API to allow users to store details of where and when they caught each Pokémon.

**Map Integration**: Visualizing caught Pokémon on an interactive map using an external mapping library.
