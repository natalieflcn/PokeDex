# To Do List

## Week: December 4 – December 6

### Goals

- [ ] Review the current file system and refactor files (and folders, if necessary) to properly reflect the MVC model
  - [x] Create public folder to serve static assets (i.e. fonts, images) instead of cluttering everything inside src folder
- [x] Switch from using Parcel to Webpack & Babel to bundle code
  - [x] Uninstall Parcel, install Webpack, and configure Webpack bundler with Babel
  - [x] Adjust file structure to accomodate the change of bundler technology
  - [x] Resolve file paths of images, favicon, CSS, and font files that were shifted around the project
